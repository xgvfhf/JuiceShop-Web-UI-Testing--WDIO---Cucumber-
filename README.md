This project is an automated UI testing suite for the OWASP Juice Shop application, built using WebdriverIO, Cucumber (BDD), and the Page Object Model.
It verifies the presence and behavior of key UI components such as the navigation bar, language selector, paginator controls, and side menu items.
The test suite provides stable, end-to-end validation to ensure UI consistency, usability, and reliable visual feedback across core application pages.
